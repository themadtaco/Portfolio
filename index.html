        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Fabian Uribe and I am a 26 year old Mexican American from Alabama.
            I am currently working at Target and have had many different jobs over the past few years.
            I have always been interested in computers and technology. I even attended a few years of college for business and computer science.
            I ended up dropping out and started doing odd jobs here and there. While doing that I started taking udemy courses on web development and enjoyed them quite a bit.
            I decided to get a job that would pay for my education so I could save money and still advance my learning. Now I am taking a full stack bootcamp at MSU and hope to land a job in Web Development after I finish the course. 
        </p>
